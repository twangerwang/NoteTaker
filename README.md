# NoteTaker

Create a note taking app that takes in a title and text for each note and displays them as entries on a menu. You can go back and click on a previously entered note to show the note and its contents. You can also delete a note by clicking on a trash icon that is present on each note. 

The app uses Express.js as the backend server, reads and saves from a JSON file, and is deployed using Heroku. 

## Description
*On page load the user is presented with the title page and a get started button. 

*Upon clicking the get started button, the user is presented with the contents of the previously saved notes (if there are any) on the left side of the screen. 

*New note form can be accessed by a plus button on the top right. Upon filling out the new note, the new note can be saved by a save button on the top right.

*Previously entered notes can be recalled by clicking on it. 

*Old notes can be deleted using the trash button on each entry.
